  "description": "KidsTrack is an organization that develops wearables like watches that are worn by kids and they contain GPS which transmits the location information every 2 mins. These are orderedby parents to track their childrenâ€™s location. Typically, the parents order the watches and putthem on their kids and enable tracking. In a web portal, the parents look at their locationmovements periodically. Also, the parents can set a geofence which if the kid breaches, anotification is triggered to ensure the kid does not go off limits. E.g.: The geo fence could bea society limit. So, if the kid tries to go off limits of society, parents are notified andimmediately they can act.",
